IoT Patient Monitoring System with Web App and Arduino Components
This repository contains the source code and documentation for an IoT-based patient monitoring system. The system utilizes Arduino components for data acquisition from various sensors and a web application for real-time monitoring and analysis of patient data. This Readme provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting up and using the system.

Features
Real-time monitoring of patient vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature.
Alerts and notifications for abnormal vital signs, allowing timely intervention.
Secure data transmission and storage.
Historical data visualization and analysis.
User-friendly web interface for easy interaction and control.
Components
The system consists of the following major components:

Arduino-based data acquisition module:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) for sensor interfacing and data processing.
Vital sign sensors (e.g., pulse rate sensor, blood pressure sensor, temperature sensor) for data acquisition.
Wi-Fi or Ethernet module for connecting the Arduino to the internet.
Web Application:

Backend server: Handles data storage, processing, and communication with the Arduino module.
Frontend interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface for real-time monitoring, alerts, and historical data visualization.
Database: Stores patient data for further analysis and retrieval.
Setup and Installation
To set up the IoT patient monitoring system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SaidiAgibu/IOT-Patient-monitoring-system.git
Arduino Setup:

Connect the necessary sensors (e.g., pulse rate temperature) to the Arduino board.
Connect the Wi-Fi or Ethernet module to the Arduino board.
Upload the Arduino code (arduino_code.ino) to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any other compatible software.
Web Application Setup:

Install the required dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
Set up the backend server to handle data storage and processing. You may need to configure a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Configure the database connection and other necessary settings in the configuration file (config.py).
Start the backend server by running the appropriate command (nodemon server.js).
Set up the frontend interface by following the instructions provided in the frontend directory.
Accessing the Web Application:

Open a web browser and enter the URL or IP address of the web application.
Register a new user account or use existing credentials to log in.
Once logged in, you should be able to view the real-time patient data, receive alerts, and access historical data.
Usage
The Arduino module continuously collects patient vital sign data from the sensors and transmits it to the backend server via NodeMcu esp8266.
The backend server processes and stores the received data in the database.
The web application provides a user interface to monitor real-time patient data, view historical data, and receive alerts for abnormal vital signs.
Users can interact with the web application to view patient data, set thresholds for alerts, and generate reports.
